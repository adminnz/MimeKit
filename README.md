## History

As a developer and user of Electronic Mail clients, I had come to realize that the vast majority of E-Mail client
(and server) software had less-than-satisfactory MIME implementations. More often than not these E-Mail clients
created broken MIME messages and/or would incorrectly try to parse a MIME message thus subtracting from the full
benefits that MIME was meant to provide. MimeKit is meant to address this issue by following the MIME specification
as closely as possible while also providing programmers with an extremely easy to use high-level API.

This led me, at first, to implement another MIME parser library called [GMime](http://spruce.sourceforge.net/gmime)
which is implemented in C and later added a C# binding called GMime-Sharp.

Now that I typically find myself working in C# rather than lower level languages like C, I decided to
begin writing a new parser in C# which would not depend on GMime. This would also allow me to have more
flexibility in that I'd be able use Generics and create a more .NET-compliant API.

## Building

First, you'll need to clone MimeKit and Bouncy Castle from my GitHub repository:

    git clone https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit.git
    git clone https://github.com/jstedfast/bc-csharp.git

Currently, MimeKit depends on the visual-studio-2010 branch of bc-csharp for the Visual Studio 2010 project
files that I've added (to replace the Visual Studio 2003 project files). To switch to that branch,

    cd bc-csharp
    git checkout -b visual-studio-2010 origin/visual-studio-2010

In the top-level MimeKit source directory, there are two solution files: MimeKitDesktopOnly.sln and MimeKit.sln.

MimeKitDesktopOnly.sln just includes the .NET Framework 4.0 C# project (MimeKit/MimeKit.csproj) and the UnitTests
project (UnitTests/UnitTests.csproj).

MimeKit.sln includes everything that is in the MimeKitDesktopOnly solution as well as the projects for Xamarin.Android,
Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Mac.

If you don't have the Xamarin products, you'll probably want to open the MimeKitDesktopOnly.sln instead of MimeKit.sln.

Once you've opened the appropriate MimeKit solution file in either Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio 2010+ (either will work),
you can simply choose the Debug or Release build configuration and then build.

Note: The Release build will generate the xml API documentation, but the Debug build will not.

## Using MimeKit

### Parsing Messages

One of the more common operations that MimeKit is meant for is parsing email messages from arbitrary streams.
There are two ways of accomplishing this task.

The first way is to use one of the Load() methods on MimeKit.MimeMessage:

    // Load a MimeMessage from a stream
    var message = MimeMessage.Load (stream);

The second way is to use the MimeParser class. For the most part, using the MimeParser directly is not necessary
unless you wish to parse a Unix mbox file stream. However, this is how you would do it:

    // Load a MimeMessage from a stream
    var parser = new MimeParser (stream, MimeFormat.Entity);
    var message = parser.ParseMessage ();

For Unix mbox file streams, you would use the parser like this:

    // Load every message from a Unix mbox
    var parser = new MimeParser (stream, MimeFormat.Mbox);
    while (!parser.IsEndOfStream) {
        var message = parser.ParseMessage ();
        
        // do something with the message
    }

### Traversing a MimeMessage

Once you have parsed a MimeMessage, you'll most likely want to traverse the tree of MIME entities.

The MimeMessage.Body is the top-level MIME entity of the message. Generally, it will either be a
TextPart or a Multipart.

As an example, if you wanted to render the MimeMessage to some sort of UI control, you might
use code similar to this:

    void RenderMessage (MimeMessage message)
    {
        RenderMimeEntity (message.Body);
    }

    void RenderMimeEntity (MimeEntity entity)
    {
        if (entity is MessagePart) {
            // This entity is an attached message/rfc822 mime part.
            var messagePart = (MessagePart) entity;
           
            // If you'd like to render this inline instead of treating
            // it as an attachment, you would just continue to recurse:
            RenderMessage (messagePart.Message);
        } else if (entity is Multipart) {
            // This entity is a multipart container.
            var multipart = (Multipart) entity;
            
            foreach (var subpart in multipart)
                RenderMimeEntity (subpart);
        } else {
            // Everything that isn't either a MessagePart or a Multipart is a MimePart
            var part = (MimePart) entity;
            
            // Don't render anything that is explicitly marked as an attachment.
            if (part.IsAttachment)
                return;
            
            if (part is TextPart) {
                // This is a mime part with textual content.
                var text = (TextPart) part;
                
                if (text.ContentType.Matches ("text", "html"))
                    RenderHtml (text.Text);
                else
                    RenderText (text.Text);
            } else if (entity.ContentType.Matches ("image", "*")) {
                using (var content = new MemoryStream ()) {
                    // If the content is base64 encoded (which it probably is), decode it.
                    part.ContentObject.DecodeTo (memory);
                    
                    RenderImage (memory);
                }
            }
        }
    }

### Verifying S/MIME and PGP/MIME Digital Signatures

Both S/MIME and PGP/MIME use a multipart/signed to contain the signed content and the detached signature data.

A multipart/signed contains exactly 2 parts: the first MimeEntity is the signed content while the second
MimeEntity is the detached signature and, by default, will either be an ApplicationPgpSignature part or
an ApplicationPkcs7Signature part.

Because the multipart/signed part may have been signed by multiple signers, it is important to
verify each of the digital signatures (one for each signer) that are returned by the
MultipartSigned.Verify() method:

    if (entity is MultipartSigned) {
        var signed = (MultipartSigned) entity;
        
        foreach (var signature in signed.Verify ()) {
            try {
                bool valid = signature.Verify ();
                
                // If valid is true, then it signifies that the signed content has not been
                // modified since this particular signer signed the content.
                //
                // However, if it is false, then it indicates that the signed content has been
                // modified.
            } catch (DigitalSignatureVerifyException) {
                // There was an error verifying the signature.
            }
        }
    }

## Contributing

The first thing you'll need to do is fork MimeKit to your own GitHub repository. Once you do that,

    git clone git@github.com/<your-account>/MimeKit.git

If you use [Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/studio) or [MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.org), both MimeKit.sln
and MimeKitDesktopOnly.sln are configured with the coding style used by MimeKit. If you use Visual Studio or some
other editor, please try to maintain the existing coding style as best as you can.

Once you've got some changes that you'd like to submit upstream to the official MimeKit repository,
simply send me a Pull Request and I will try to review your changes in a timely manner.
